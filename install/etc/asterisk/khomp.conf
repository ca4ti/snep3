[cadences]

;; Default value for cadences. You may define your own cadences, and
;; also use them in the Dial arguments as "ring_cadence=your_cadence_name".
;;
;; "0,0" means a continuous dialtone, only valid for audio generation
;; (i.e. cannot be used for ringing an FXS channel).
;;
;; (default as defined below, independent of compatibility mode,
;; and only to be used in Dial arguments)

; co-dialtone  = 0,0
; vm-dialtone  = 1000,100,100,100
; pbx-dialtone = 1000,100
; fast-busy    = 100,100
; ringback     = 1000,4000
; waiting-call = 100,100,100,3700
; ring         = 1000,4000

;; If choose compatibily mode like DAHDI in compatibility session, the 
;; cadences must be a sequential number starts by 1, to be used in dial string.
;;
;; ex: Dial(Khomp/1r1/9901)
;; 
;; Note: Negative values are not accepted, to configuring where the caller ID spill is
;; to be placed, use the properly configuration section.
;;
;; (default as defined below)

; 1 = 125,125,2000,4000
; 2 = 250,250,500,1000
; 3 = 125,125,125,125
; 4 = 1000,500,2000,4000

[fxs-branches]

;; In this section, you should define options using the following syntax:
;;
;; 'orig_prefix = serial number 0, serial number 1, ...'
;;
;; ex: '800 = 1234,4535' (without quotes)
;;
;; In the example above (assuming KFXS-SPX boards 1234 and 4535), the
;; branches will be numbered from 800 to 829 in board 1234, and from
;; 830 to 859 in board 4535.


;;;;
;;;; Section for configuring FXS hotlines.
;;;;

[fxs-hotlines]

;; In this section, you should define options using the following syntax:
;;
;; 'orig_prefix = destination_number'
;;
;; ex: '804 = 32332933' (without quotes)
;;
;; In the example above, the branch numbered 804 will call the number
;; 3233-2933 (Khomp support number) every time the FXS branch goes off hook.


;;;
;;; Section for configuring specific options for FXS branches.
;;;

[fxs-options]

;; In this section, you should define options using the following syntax:
;;
;; 'orig_prefix = option1:value | option2:value | option3:value' ...
;;
;; ex: '804 = pickupgroup:1,4-15 | output-volume:+2' (without quotes)
;;

;; In the example above, the branch numbered 804 will have specific
;; configuration for 'pickupgroup' and default output volume set to +2.
;;
;; Possible values to options is:
;; pickupgroup, callgroup, namedpickupgroup, namedcallgroup, context, input-volume, 
;; output-volume, language, mohclass, amaflags, accountcode, calleridnum, calleridname,
;; mailbox, setvar.
